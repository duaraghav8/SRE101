User: My payments-service Pod is not running because it is unable to pull the container image
from my private docker registry. How can I authenticate with my dockerhub registry? Give me
example code.
AI: To authenticate with a private Docker registry like Docker Hub, you need to create a
Kubernetes Secret of type docker-registry and then reference it in your Pod or Deployment.
Here's how you can do it:

 1 Create a Docker Registry Secret:
   Use the following command to create a secret. Replace <your-docker-username>,
   <your-docker-password>, <your-docker-email>, and <your-docker-server> with your Docker Hub
   credentials and server URL (usually https://index.docker.io/v1/ for Docker Hub).

    kubectl create secret docker-registry my-dockerhub-secret \
      --docker-username=<your-docker-username> \
      --docker-password=<your-docker-password> \
      --docker-email=<your-docker-email> \
      --docker-server=<your-docker-server>

 2 Reference the Secret in Your Pod or Deployment:
   Add the imagePullSecrets section to your Pod or Deployment YAML file to use the secret for
   pulling images.

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: payments-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: payments-container
        image: <your-private-image>
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: my-dockerhub-secret

   For a Deployment, it would look similar:

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: payments-service
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: payments-service
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: payments-service
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: payments-container
            image: <your-private-image>
          imagePullSecrets:
          - name: my-dockerhub-secret


This setup will allow your Kubernetes cluster to authenticate with Docker Hub and pull the
private images using the provided credentials.
