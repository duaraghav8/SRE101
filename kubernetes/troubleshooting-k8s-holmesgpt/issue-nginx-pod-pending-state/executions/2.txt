User: Why is my Nginx pod stuck in Pending state? Can you explain the root cause to me in as
much detail as possible? If you want to examine my configurations or any other aspects of my
kubernetes cluster, ask for the information. Share the steps I can take to verify the problem
myself. If there is any issue with any specific Kubernetes resource, share the name of the
resource as well. If there are any issues in my resource configurations, point them out. Also

Running `kubectl get -A --show-labels -o wide pod | grep nginx`                   tools.py:83

AI: The Nginx pod nginx-deployment-675457bd68-s2r8r is stuck in the Pending state due to
scheduling issues. Here's a detailed breakdown:

 1 Node Affinity/Selector Mismatch: The pod has a node selector
   node-role.kubernetes.io/app-ready=true, but no nodes match this label. Node selectors are
   used to constrain a pod to run on nodes with specific labels.
 2 Taints and Tolerations: One node has an untolerated taint {status: pending_upgrade}.
   Taints and tolerations are used to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate
   nodes.
 3 Pod Anti-Affinity Rules: One node didn't match the pod anti-affinity rules. Anti-affinity
   rules prevent pods from being scheduled on certain nodes based on the presence of other
   pods.

                                 Steps to Verify the Problem

 1 Check Node Labels: Run kubectl get nodes --show-labels to verify if any node has the label
   node-role.kubernetes.io/app-ready=true.
 2 Check Node Taints: Run kubectl describe node <node-name> to see the taints on nodes and
   verify if any node has the taint {status: pending_upgrade}.
 3 Review Pod Anti-Affinity Rules: Check the deployment or pod spec for any anti-affinity
   rules that might be causing the issue.

                                          Solutions

 1 Update Node Selector: If the node selector is incorrect, update it to match the available
   nodes. Edit the deployment with kubectl edit deployment nginx-deployment and change the
   node selector.

    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/app-ready: "true" # Change this to match an existing node
    label

 2 Add Tolerations: If the taint is necessary, add a toleration to the pod spec to allow it
   to be scheduled on the tainted node.

    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "status"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "pending_upgrade"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

 3 Adjust Anti-Affinity Rules: Review and adjust any anti-affinity rules that might be too
   restrictive.

                                          Concepts

 • Node Selector: Constrains a pod to run on nodes with specific labels.
 • Taints and Tolerations: Mechanism to repel pods from nodes unless they tolerate the taint.
 • Pod Anti-Affinity: Prevents pods from being scheduled on certain nodes based on the
   presence of other pods.

By following these steps, you can resolve the scheduling issues and get the Nginx pod
running.
